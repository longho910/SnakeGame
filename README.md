### Project Title

SNAKE GAME PROJECT

### Description

- Making use of Java to create Snake Game
- The player controls a long snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up an apple, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats an apple, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
